## DAT-07 MovieLens Recommender System

This is my final project for [General Assembly LA's Data Science course](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science?where=los-angeles). I wanted to build a recommender system using the MovieLens data set trying out both user-based collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering and exploring the pros and cons of both. [recommendations.py](recommendations.py) contains the code I wrote for the recommender system. [recommender-movielens.ipynb](recommender-movielens.ipynb) contains a presentation of my project in an IPython notebook.
